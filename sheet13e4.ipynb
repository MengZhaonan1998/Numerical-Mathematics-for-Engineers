    "In this last exercise we'll extend the FEM-method we implemented last time. For a given mesh in two-dimensions with linear finite elements we want to approximate the Possion equation, with both Neumann and Dirchlet boundary conditions on different parts of the boundary.  As last time suppose you are given a domain $\\Omega\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^2$ and a decomposition of boundary $\\partial\\Omega$ as a disjoint union of multiple connected components:\n",
